/**
 * `Button` is an `NSManagedObject` subclass that models a button for a home theater remote
 * control. Its main function is to represent the visual attributes of the button, which are used
 * by a <ButtonView> in the user interface, and to be a means for executing commands, which are
 * encapsulated in a <Command> object. Different styles and behaviors can be achieved by changing
 * the button's `type` attribute. <ActivityButton> subclasses `Button` to coordinate launching and
 * exiting activities, which are coordinated by a <RemoteController>.
