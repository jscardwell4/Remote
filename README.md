Remote
======
The app has been stripped down to what I have gotten back into working order so far. Only the 'Remote' button in the main menu is enabled.

The 'CoreData' folder contains the json files used to create the remote. I stripped this down to essentials. On the 'Activities' screen of the remote, only the 'Dish' activity leads anywhere. The top bar buttons have been disabled accept for the top left button that leads back to the launch screen.
