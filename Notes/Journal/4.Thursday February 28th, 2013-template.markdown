============================

I need to trace and document the process by which constraints are added/removed and
managed in general when responding to editing commands like aligning and resizing.
After which, I would like to come up with a solid set of use case scenarios that can
be tested with the `UITestRunner`. A good place to start would be to simply document
the tests I have already created as use cases.
