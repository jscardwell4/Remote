=========================

Figure out why layout configuration isn't being updated. Just started changing implementation
of layout configuration to use core data model.

###Update

I have gotten some of the UI tests working again. Next up is the button group scale test, which
I think is broken because of the way the editor relies on pinch gestures for setting `_flags.appliedScale`.
