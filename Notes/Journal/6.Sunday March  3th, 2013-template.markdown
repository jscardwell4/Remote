=======================

I have been reworking the flow of `RemoteElement` - `RemoteElementLayoutConstraint` insertion, deletion, and update notifications.
I need to finish getting this aspect settled and then get resizing to sibling element working. After which, I need to run the
`MSRemoteUITests` to make sure everything is functioning as expected. Known issues to fix include:

* Resizing and scaling operations should not allow for any portion to appear offscreen.
* Probably other things that I have forgotten.
