=======================

I need to add `requiresConstraintBasedLayout` to `REView` and then have a look
at the flow of constraint changes through `updateConstraints` to figure out how things need
to be modified to ensure changes are reflected in the user interface appropriately. For example,
in button group alignment test #8 the resize occurs appropriately but the following alignment to
center x does not get drawn to the screen. Also, there are a couple of cases where
 `[REView shrinkwrap]` are not working, not working at all with scaling operations.
