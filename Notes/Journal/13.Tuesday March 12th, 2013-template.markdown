========================

Today should be spent overhauling `RemoteElementConstraintManager`. Things to do include:

* Determining where `[NSManagedObjectContext performBlock:]` and `[NSManagedObjectContext performBlockAndWait:]` should go
* Which responsibilities, if any, should be moved to `RemoteElementLayoutConfiguration`. For example, should configurations
receive notifications regarding the first item constraints of their element so they may update themselves?
* When should proportion lock actually be removed?
* Rework creation/deletion of `RemoteElementLayoutConstraint` objects so that they go through `RemoteElement` collection accessors.
* Look at how to expand support for cases where an element has more than one constraint for a specific attribute.
