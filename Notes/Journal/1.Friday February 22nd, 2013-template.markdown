==========================

`MSMultiselectGestureRecognizer` seems to be in a better state. Now I need to
re-enable the other gestures in `RemoteElementEditingViewController` to see what
changes need to be made to have them all play nicely together. Basic log statements
need to be added to the editor to provide the story of which gesture is receiving
actions. Some thought, on paper, should be given to the individual state machines
for the editing gestures and how they fit into the interface as a whole.

Pending completion of the above, it would be nice to get to adding more menu interactions
such as copy, delete, duplicate, copy style, edit, etc. I just realized that since
the icons are really glyphs in a font, they should be able to appear in the menu.


###Update

Things that need doing in editor:

- Gestures are taking touches away from bottom toolbars
- Scaling is not working
- Make sure that any translation or scaling is bounded by the screen
